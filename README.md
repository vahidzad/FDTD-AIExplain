# FDTD-AIExplain

The machine learning prediction of the optical absorption of plasmon@Semiconductor core-Shell nanocylinders.


# Background

The optical responses of plasmon@Semiconductor core-Shell nanocylinders were simulated using finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method. The data generated by the simulation can be found here:

A convolutional neural network (CNN) in combination with multilayer perceptron was ustilized to generate the optical absorption.

The trained model was analysed by employing a brand new framework for analysing the behaviour of neural networks, which is named SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations):
